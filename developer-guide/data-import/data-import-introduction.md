On the 4th of March 2022, **ADD LINK** PFI (ProcessForce Import) plugin for AppEngine was released. PFI allows importing/updating data to ProcessForce objects. The idea behind this plugin is to be a simplified, swifter, and more adjustable alternative for PowerShell updates.

If you take our scripts and modify them, which then causes an issue of any sort which requires our team to spend time reviewing your scripts etc., we will charge you for the time spent in fixing these issues on a time and material basis at an hourly rate of 150 EUR/USD, plus expenses if applicable. Before any work is started, an email confirmation is required between both parties that these charges will be applied and accepted.
