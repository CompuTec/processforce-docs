How to add a hierarchical object such as Operation Routing or Bill Of Material using ProcessForce API

---

## Short information about Hierarchical data in PF Technology

When adding Operations to a Resource, you have to:

1. Make sure that you are in an empty operation row:

  ```csharp

  //Set current row to last position
rtg.Operations.SetCurrentLine(rtg.Operations.Count-1)
//Check if this line is not empty
if(!string.IsNullOrEmpty(rtg.Operations.U_OprCode))
    rtg.Operations.Add()

  ```

2. Set the U_OprCode value of the Operation you want to add. After setting this value, all correspondent information is added to Routing (Operation Properties, Resources, Resource Properties with the default values taken from Operation object), and filled U_RtgOprCode will get the new value ( U_OprCode +U_RtgOprCode is a unique key for this operation):

  ```csharp
  rtg.Operations.U_OprCode = "Planing";
  ```

3. when you want to add something on a second or more level (for example, Routing-Operation-Resources), you have to set the parent information first:

  ```csharp
  rtg.OperationResources.U_RtgOprCode = 1;
  ```

  and after that, you can set up a new Resource for this Operation. Off course, all his child's and default Values will be added automatically:

  ```csharp
  rtg.OperationResources.U_RscCode = "plane01";
  ```

4. When you want to replace any Resources, you can simply change only its U_RscCode, and API will remove all previous data and fill it with a new one.

 I. Creating new Routing

    - Create a routing object using the CreatePFObject method

    - Set Mandatory header Information
    
    - Set Child Data
    
    - Add an object to the database

  ```csharp
IRouting rtg = company.CreatePFObject(CompuTec.ProcessForce.API.Core.ObjectTypes.Routing);
                    rtg.U_RtgCode = "DIRtg1";
                    rtg.U_RtgName = "Test Routing";
                    /// Adding Operation To Resource
                    /// Notice that after setting this code, all relative resources and other information will automatically load into the routing
                    /// and U_RtgOprCode  will automatically receive the value that will be a key for this specific operation
                    rtg.Operations.U_OprCode = "Planing";
                    var operationKey = rtg.Operations.U_RtgOprCode;
                    ///now we will try to add another resource for this specific operation.
                    ///
                    rtg.OperationResources.SetCurrentLine(rtg.OperationResources.Count - 1);
                    if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(rtg.OperationResources.U_RscCode))//Check if last line in udoobject is empty if not add new line
                        rtg.OperationResources.Add();
 
                    ///First set operation Key for with you want to add resource
                    rtg.OperationResources.U_RtgOprCode = operationKey;
                    //Again after setting ResourceCode all related information will be loaded
                    rtg.OperationResources.U_RscCode = "plane01";
                    ///U_RtgOprRscCode and U_RtgOprCode will be a key for OperationResourceProperty
                    ///Add Another Operation
                    rtg.Operations.Add();
                    rtg.Operations.U_OprCode = "Cutting";
                    rtg.Add();
   ```

  II. Updating BillOfMaterial setting previously creating Routing

     - Create BillOfMaterialObject

     - Load data from the database using the GetByItemCodeAndRevision method

     - Add new Routing (note that setting bom.Routing.U_RtgCode will cause loading of all data to bom object)

     - Update Object

```csharp
 IBillOfMaterial bom = company.CreatePFObject(CompuTec.ProcessForce.API.Core.ObjectTypes.BillOfMaterial);
                    if (bom.GetByItemCodeAndRevision("Chair01", "") == 0)
                    {
                        bom.Routings.SetCurrentLine(bom.Routings.Count - 1);
                        if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(bom.Routings.U_RtgCode))
                            bom.Routings.Add();
                        bom.Routings.U_RtgCode = "DIRtg1";
                        bom.Routings.U_IsDefault = "Y";
                        bom.Update();
                    }
                    else
                        Console.WriteLine("Bill of material was not found.");
```
