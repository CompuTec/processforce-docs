# Working with User-Defined Fields

A possibility to add User-Defined Fields (UDFs) is an SAP Business One option that can also be used with ProcessForce objects.

Supplementary fields are often added to master data and documents to meet specific customers’ business process requirements.

In this section working on UDFs with ProcessForce is described. Please check the respective SAP Business One documentation [the respective SAP Business One documentation entry](https://help.sap.com/viewer/68a2e87fb29941b5bf959a184d9c6727/10.0/en-US/4510ff7bcf465d7be10000000a11466f.html), to find out more about the SAP Business One UDF option.

## Adding UDFs

:::danger

It is impossible to add UDFs to the Costed Bill of Materials form.

:::

:::danger

Adding UDFs to Item Costing and Resource Costing forms may cause errors and is not recommended.

:::

:::caution

Only users with the following SAP Business One authorization assigned can add UDFs: Customization Tools → User-Defined Fields - Management.

You can reach this option in the Authorizations form: Administration → System Initialization → Authorizations → General Authorizations.

:::

:::info

In the examples used in this section, adding UDF to the Bill of Materials is used.

:::

- To add a UDF, go to the upper menu Tools → Customization Tools → User-Defined Fields - Management. You can reach ProcessForce tables in User Tables:

  ![User Tables](./media/udf-tables.png)

  UDF can be added either to a form's header or a row.

  <details>
  <summary>Header and Row</summary>
  
  ![Header and rows](./media/bom-header-rows.png)

  </details>

  ProcessForce headers have simple names, e.g., BOM. ProcessForce rows have names combined from a form name and a row name, e.g., BOM: Items, BOM: Scrap.

- Choose the place that you want to add UDF to and click Add (Bill of Materials, Items in this example):

  ![Add UDF](./media/udf-add.png)

- Fill in all desired fields (check [the respective SAP Business One documentation entry](http://help.sap.com/saphelp_sboh92/helpdata/en/45/10ff7bcf465d7be10000000a11466f/content.htm) for more information) and click Add.

  ![Fields](./media/field-data-add.png)

  Note that Title, Type, and Structure fields cannot be edited once the field is added. You can remove UDF and add it again.

- Information about a database structure change will be displayed. Accept it.

- Information about other workstations connected to the company with a list of workstations will be displayed. You can either ignore it, try again after disconnecting it, or cancel.

  :::caution

  Adding UDFs changes the database structure, therefore, it is recommended to disconnect all the other users logged in to the SAP Business One database on which the change is to be performed.

  :::

- Restart SAP Business One client.

### Header UDFs

UDFs added to a header are not displayed on it. You can check it on a side panel (you can reach it by using the View → User-Defined Fields menu or pressing Ctrl+Shift+U):

![Header UDFs](./media/udfs-header.png)

### Row UDFs

UDFs added to a row are displayed as another column in the row table:

![Row UDF](./media/udf-row-test.png)

### *Flat* forms

Some forms do not have tables (rows), e.g., Downtime Reason. In this case, you can add UDF only in the same manner as header UDFs: it will not be available on a form. It will be available on a side panel:

![Downtime Reson UDFs](./media/udfs-downtime-reason.png)

### Form Settings

You can manage the visibility and activity of a UDF by standard SAP Business One option: Form Settings, chosen on a specific form. Newly created UDFs are visible and active by default.

Note that only row UDFs are available in Form Settings.

![Form Settings](./media/udfs-form-settings.png)

## ProcessForce UDFs on SAP Business One forms: recommended Form Settings

Installing ProcessForce causes adding ProcessForce UDFs to some of the SAP Business One forms, e.g., Revision on Sales Order:

![Sales Order UDF](./media/udfs-sales-order.png)

Keeping ProcessForce UDFs placed on SAP B1 forms visible in Form Settings is recommended. Turning off the option leads to a blockage of the fields update during transactions and may lead to data inconsistency.
