# Bill of Materials

Bill of Materials lists all materials used to produce a specific product. ProcessForce also allows us to define other vital values during the production of a product: Coproducts, Scraps, or Work in Progress Items.

ProcessForce also allows creating Revisions: different Bills of Materials for one Item.
