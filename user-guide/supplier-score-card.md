# Supplier Score Card

ProcessForce Supplier Score Card is a reporting function based on a weighted supplier scorecard. It helps to evaluate Suppliers' performance based on information about quality, quantity accuracy, and punctuality of deliveries.

---

:::warning
- Delivery and Quantity calculations on Supplier Score Card are made based on Purchase Order and Goods Receipt PO documents. A specific Purchase Order and Goods Receipt PO must be linked for the function to work correctly. It can be done by creating a Goods Receipt PO by using Copy To option on a Purchase Order or connecting the Purchase Order by Copy From Option on Goods Receipt PO.

- Dates are compared between lines of documents (not document header dates).

### Header

Here you can define additional settings for a specific Supplier related to delivery and quantity.

- No of Days Early and No of Days Late define a period before and after the order date in which delivery is still acceptable,

    Example

    The order date is 16.11.2016

    No of Days Early: 2

    No of Days Late: 2

    Every delivery before 14.11.2016 will be deemed as early, and every delivery after 18.11.2016 will be considered late.

- Quantity Over % and Quantity Under % define a range of quantity of delivery that is still acceptable.

    Example

    The ordered quantity is 100.

    Quantity Over %: 10

    Quantity Under %: 10

    Everything delivery less than 90 will be deemed too small, and delivery bigger than 110 will be considered too big.

### Summary

Weighted Values - are defined for each weight in General Settings, e.g.,  No. Of Complaints, No. of Failed QC Tests, No of Returns, etc.

Month to Date - the total of transactions for the current month; e.g., if now is 15th October, transactions from 1st October until 15th October are considered.

Month to date relates to the weighted values calculated in the current month.

The previous month - the weighted values calculated in the last month.

Year to Date - relates to the total of each month's weighted values to the current month, e.g., January to May, where May is the current month.

The previous year - relates to the total of each month's weighted value for an entire 12-month period, i.e., January to December.

#### Details tab Calculation

Note Grade = Amount / Total and Weighted Score = Weight x Grade

|:-----------:|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|:----------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| No. On Time | D = Total number of GRPOs where the GRPO Posting Date is = to Purchase Order Delivery Date                             | ( D / Total number of GRPO ) x No on Time (value from General setting) |
| No. Early   | E = Total number of GRPOs where the GRPO Posting Date - No of Days Early Value is < than Purchase Order Delivery Date  | ( E / Total number of GRPO ) x No Early (value from General setting)   |
| No. Late    | F = Total number of GRPOs where the GRPO Posting Date + No of Days Late Value is → than Purchase Order Delivery Date   | ( F / Total number of GRPO ) x No Late (value from General setting)    |

|  Quantity |                                              No of                                              |                             Weighted Value                            |
|:---------:|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|:---------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| No. Equal | G = a Total number of GRPOs where the Purchase Order and GRPO quantity are the same             | ( G / Total number of GRPO ) x No Equal (value from General Settings) |
| No. Over  | H = Total number of GRPO where the quantity is → the Purchase Order quantity + Quantity Over %  | ( H / Total number of GRPO ) x No Over (value from General Settings)  |
| No. Under | I = Total number of GRPO where the quantity is < the Purchase Order quantity - Quantity Under % | ( I / Total number of GRPO ) x No Under (value from General Settings) |
