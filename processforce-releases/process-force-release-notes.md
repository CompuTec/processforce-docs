## ProcessForce 10.0 Release 15 (R15)

4 July 2022

:::danger
Due to major changes to the Costing mechanism, the following conditions have to be met for the Costing to work properly:

 - Direct Data Access has to be enabled to use Roll-up, Update Costing, Costed BOM or Cost Comparison
   
 - Batch Size value and Batch Result quantities are used in Roll-up for unit cost calculation.

Please note that the @CT_PF_MOR5 table will be removed from a database during an upgrade to this version and this change is irreversible. We strongly recommend performing a backup before the upgrade.  Documents related to inventory transactions displayed in the Manufacturing Order Documents tab were recorded in the @CT_PF_MOR5 table. Making them available through the CT_PF_MOR5 view instead significantly improves performance on documents with long lists (over 100 rows). Please note that if you used the @CT_PF_MOR5 table for any custom solutions (e.g. Crystal Reports, TransactionNotification or PostTransactionNotification), you have to modify them to use the CT_PF_MOR5 view instead. If some User-Defined Fields were added to the @CT_PF_MOR5 table during implementation, they have to be moved to another place to stay operational. | Please note that the @CT_PF_MOR5 table will be removed from a database during an upgrade to this version and this change is irreversible.

Making them available through the CT_PF_MOR5 view instead significantly improves performance on documents with long lists (over 100 rows). Please note that if you used the @CT_PF_MOR5 table for any custom solutions (e.g. Crystal Reports, TransactionNotification or PostTransactionNotification), you have to modify them to use the CT_PF_MOR5 view instead. If some User-Defined Fields were added to the @CT_PF_MOR5 table during implementation, they have to be moved to another place to stay operational. |                    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                                                                                                                                                                                                         |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |   |

## ProcessForce 10.0 Release 8 (R8)

17 March 2021

:::caution
If you are upgrading from a version lower than 10.0 R8 to 10.0 R8 or higher, please expect that the upgrade time will be significantly longer than usual. This is because, as of this version, CompuTec ProcessForce now includes Plant Maintenance functionalities and all the associated data structures will have to be created during the upgrade.
