:::warning

Please Note

**Note 1** If the support team spends time working on a support ticket, and the issue is related to incorrect installation of the add-on and SAP Business One, e.g., DI API, 32-bit/64-bit versions, SAP Business One related problem, UDFs, Formatted Searches (FMS), Transaction Notification, issues related to Boyum B1UP configurations added by the customer and partner which affects our solution, and not checked the release notes for new configuration functions, we will charge you for the time spent in fixing and reviewing these issues on a time and material basis at an hourly rate of 150 EUR/USD, plus expenses if applicable, and will be automatically invoiced.

**Note 2** If you take our scripts and modify them, which then causes an issue of any sort which requires our team to spend time reviewing your scripts etc., we will charge you for the time spent in fixing these issues on a time and material basis at an hourly rate of 150 EUR/USD, plus expenses if applicable. Before any work is started, an e-mail confirmation is required between both parties that these charges will be applied for and accepted.

**Note 3** If the support team spends time on a support ticket, and the issue is related to not following standard ProcessForce master data configuration, we will charge you for the time spent in fixing and reviewing these issues on a time and material basis at an hourly rate of 150 EUR/USD, plus expenses if applicable, and will be automatically invoiced.

## Support Policy

- A bug fix occurs within the current release as a hotfix (depending on release timing) or within a future patch level depending on the priority of a bug.

- Bugs are not to be fixed in previous versions, and Patch Levels.

- Product enhancement requests are placed in a separate queue and reviewed every month to determine their suitability for a future patch release (free of charge) or paid for by the partner/customer to speed up their release.

- Please note product enhancement requests which fit the overall concepts of ProcessForce and general industry practices will be included.
