# Allergen

If a company deals with products that contain common allergens, e.g., nuts, a unique option for connecting information about it with items must be provided for safety purposes and to avoid future recalls. Allergens can be defined and assigned to a specific Master Data (Ingredient or Item Ingredient).

This form allows users to define a valid list of Allergens that can be traced within their products and materials.

This data is used within the [Ingredient Master Data](../ingredient-master-data.md) and [Item Ingredient Master Data](../ingredient-master-data.md) forms.
