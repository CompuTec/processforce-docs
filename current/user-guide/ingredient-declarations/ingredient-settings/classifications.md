# Classifications

This form allows users to define a valid list of classifications that can be assigned to products or materials. Classification records detail special requirements that products and materials must meet, such as Halal, Kosher, GM, and Bio. Corresponding certificates can be defined for classifications on Classification/Certificate tab on the Ingredient Master Data form.

This data is used within the [Ingredient Master Data](../ingredient-master-data.md).
