# Ingredient Master Data

In many instances, the Ingredient itself is an Item. For example, if the company makes fruit and nut chocolate bars, the cocoa, milk, raisins, hazel, and peanuts will be specific Items that are part of the product's Bill of Materials. Therefore, the user has the flexibility to define an Item and its detailed ingredient data.

Ingredient-defining functionality provides an extension to product Master Data giving the possibility to define information necessary to create declaration statements or ingredient listings needed on product labels.

This form allows the user to define and modify information on ingredients that are a part of products and materials and their attributes.
