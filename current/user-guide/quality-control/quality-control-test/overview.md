# Overview

## Introduction

The Quality Control Testing process is a fully integrated solution with ProcessForce and SAP Business One data, processes, and technologies.

This function uses business events/triggers and SAP Business One Alert functions to advise users that a Quality Control Test is required to be performed.

The Quality Control Test Form contains all the necessary data to understand the activities that need to take place.

## Header

This form allows the user to create a Quality Control Test.

2. Select and add a Document Series Number.
3. Select and add the Inspector performing the testing.
4. Select the required status and date. (Created, Started, On-Hold, Waiting NCMR, Closed).

Note: when moving the life cycle of the Quality Control Test, the system will require adding a date of the status change.

## Item Properties

The Item Properties tab allows the user to record the results of the Item Properties tested. It works the same way as the Test Properties tab.

The Defects tab allows the user to view the sample size and enter the test's Passed and Defect quantity results.

Defect codes can be added to categorize the failure and are used for analysis and reporting purposes.

When the Quality Control Test is complete, the user can record the type of Inventory Movement that needs to occur. Based on the selection, an Alert is sent to a specific user to conduct the appropriate inventory transaction.
