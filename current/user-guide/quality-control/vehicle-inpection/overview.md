### Visual Inspection

In this section, you can record values for different categories (e.g., Chemical Spills, Pest Inspection). You can record inspection pass or fail indicators for every category, from 1 to 3 predefined values and remarks. In the Temperature category, additionally, the temperature can be defined.
