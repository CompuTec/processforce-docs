# Certificate of Analysis

A Certificate of Analysis (CoA) is a document that confirms that a product meets its specification.

It usually presents the results of tests performed as a part of the quality control of an individual batch of a product.

CoA is typically (but not only) requested by customers in both food and chemicals industries, and for the same product, different customers might request different information on a document. ProcessForce CoA functions allow marking Test Properties and Item Properties important for a specific Business Partner which is crucial for creating individualized certificate documents.

:::info
    Currently, ProcessForce CoA function allows assigning Business Partners to a specific Test Property or Item Property. The function that generates Crystal Report using this kind of data is planned to be implemented in one of the next ProcessForce releases.
