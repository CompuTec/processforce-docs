# Quality Control Tests Pool

The pass/Failed status of the Quality Control Tests Pool is based on a predefined relation between passed and failed Quality Tests in a pool. The pass option was designed for quality control based on many samples. The quality Control Tests Pool option automatically creates a series of Quality Control Tests.

## Configuration

- **Create QC Tests Pool** – determines whether QC Tests Pool will be created for this Test Protocol.

- **Number of Samples** – the number of individual tests (on different samples) in the QC Tests Pool.

- **Test Pool Pass/Fail Quantity Condition** – conditions on which QC Tests Pool will be passed or failed. Filling one field with a value automatically fills the other one with the rest value (for the field to be summed up to the Number of Samples value.

- **Acceptance Number (Ac)** – the highest number of nonconforming units or defects in the sample that still allows the lot to be accepted.

- **Rejection Number (Re)** – the lowest number of nonconforming units or defects in a sample that leads to the rejection of the lot.

- **Ac. Re Obligatory** – defines if Acceptance number and Rejection number are required to decide about QC order releasing (if not checked, the final result of the test can be changed manually).
