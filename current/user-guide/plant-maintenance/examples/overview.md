# Overview

In this section, you can find examples of Plant Maintenance usage.

---

## Maintainable Item definition schema

Please see [here](../field-description/maintainable-item.md).

## Assigning an existing object to MI

When you define a new MI, please check the Assigned Object checkbox:

![Maintenance](./media/overview/maintenance-item-assigned.webp)

### Assigning Resource

Please select a Resource code from the list:

![Maintenance Item](./media/overview/image2020-2-19-12-14-10.png)

![Resource List](./media/overview/image2020-2-19-12-14-36.png)

:::note
    It is impossible to assign the same Resource more than once.
:::

### Assigning Apparatus (Meter, Tool, Part)

It is possible to assign an Item to MI with one of the Apparatus Types: Tool, Part, or Meter. Only this kind of Item is selectable in the List of Items. The assigned Item has to be managed by Serial Numbers.

First, select an Item from the list:

![Resource List](./media/overview/resource-list-2.webp)

Select Apparatus Type:

![Resource](./media/overview/resource-1.webp)

Select Equipment Card (first, you must define EC for SN) – not obligatory.

![Assigned Object](./media/overview/assigned-object-cfl.webp)

:::note
    The application of Equipment Card allows using standard EC functionality for MI.
:::

#### Assigning Physical Meter

If you set Apparatus Type to Meter, additional fields in the Details tab are active. To make them accessible, uncheck the Parameters Frozen checkbox.

![Checkbox](./media/overview/mi-details-checkbox.webp)

Next, you should select Meter Unit and set up the limit value for the meter (Maximum Value).

:::note
    If Maximum Value is set to 0, the meter's limit value equals infinity.
:::

![Characteristics](./media/overview/meter-charasteristic.webp)

Next, check the Frozen Parameters checkbox to save values from unauthorized modification and the OK button to save the record.

Now you have to set up the Input Value (the value you can see on the meter before assigning) and Numbers of Turn Overs (if you know this value, for example, from meter documentation). If the Counter is new, these values are probably equal to zero. Please select Physical Meter Value Setting/Correction from RMBM (on a saved record) to do this.

A meter Reading window appears. Please enter the Reading and Number of Turn Overs.

![Reading](./media/overview/meter-readings-values.webp)

:::info To save values, select buttons:
Calculate → Add → Propagate → Close Document.
:::

![Reading](./media/overview/meter-charasteristic-2.webp)

As you can see:

Input Value = Reading

Total Usage = Input Value + Number of Turns Over \* Maximum Value

In the same way, you can correct entered values if Physical Meter is not currently linked to any MI/EM. If the Meter is connected as Physical Meter to Effective Meter, you can correct these values in MI from the Effective Meter line.

## Definition of MI hierarchy with Effective Meters and linked Physical Meters

![MI Diagram](./media/overview/mi-diagram.webp)

To define the above MI structure with Effective Meters and linked Physical Meters:

1. MI hierarchy:

    - Define MI Object 001.
    - Define MI Object 002 and indicate Object 001 as a Parent MI.
    - Define MI Object 003 and indicate Object 001 as a Parent MI.

    - **Note**: You can check the MI hierarchy, please see [here](/docs/processforce/user-guide/plant-maintenance/field-description/reports#mis-structure-report).

2. Define Meter Units *(Main Menu/Administration/Setup/Stock Management/Units of Measure*):

    - Hours.
    - Pieces.
    - Meters.

3. Define EM Types. Please check [here](/docs/processforce/user-guide/plant-maintenance/field-description/maintainable-item#definition-of-em-type-and-physical-meter):

    - Hours_01 (UoM=Hours, Entry Type=Reading)
    - Pieces_01 (UoM=Pieces, Entry Type=Difference)
    - Meters_01 (UoM=Meters, Entry Type=Reading)

4. Define MIs (Physical Meters), Apparatus Type=Meter. Please see [here](../examples/overview.md):

    - Counter 01 (UoM=Hours)
    - Counter 02 (UoM=Meters).

5. Define Effective Meters (here) and link Physical Meter for Object 001:

    - Add in tab Effective Meters:

      - EM Type=Hours_01, Inherited=No, Entry Type=Difference
      - EM Type=Pieces_01, Inherited=No, Entry Type=Difference
      - Save data.
    - To EM Type Hours_01 link Physical Meter: Counter 01:

      - Select the EM Type line and use the RMBM option Physical Meter Connection; a window with Physical Meters appears.
      - Select Physical Meter Counter 01 from the list (only not linked Physical Meters are visible with the same UoM like EM type).
      - Meter Reading window is opened. Please select the button Add.
      - Linking of Physical Meter is documented by Meter Reading document (accurate description is visible in Remarks, and a checkbox Correction is checked by default). You can check that in Physical Meter Reading History (here) or Physical Meter's MI record in the Details tab, fields: Assigned to MI, Assigned to EM.
      - For EM Type Hours_01, change Entry Type to Reading.
      - Save data.

6. Define Effective Meters for Object 002:

    - Add it in the Effective tab Meters:

      - EM Type=Hours_01, Inherited=Yes, Entry Type = Difference
      - EM Type=Pieces_01, Inherited=Yes, Entry Type = Difference
      - Save data.
7. Define Effective Meters and Physical Meters for Object 003.

    - Add it in the Effective tab Meters:

      - EM Type=Hours_01, Inherited=Yes, Entry Type = Difference
      - EM Type=Pieces_01, Inherited=Yes, Entry Type = Difference
      - EM Type=Meters_02, Inherited=No, Entry Type = Difference
      - Save data
    - To EM Type Meters link Physical Meter: Counter 02:

      - Select the EM Type line and use the RMBM option Physical Meter Connection; a window with Physical Meters appears.
      - Select Physical Meter Counter 02 from the list (only not linked Physical meters are visible with the same UoM, like EM type).
      - Meter Reading window is opened. Please select the button Add.
      - Linking of Physical Meter is documented by Meter Reading document (accurate description is visible in Remarks, and a checkbox Correction is checked by default). You can check that in Physical Meter Reading History (here) or Physical Meter's MI record in tab Details, fields: Assigned to MI, Assigned to EM.
      - For EM Type, change Entry Type to Reading.
      - Save data.

:::note
    If in the child MI (Object 002) you use the identical EM Type as in parent MI (Hourse_01, Pieces_01), in the child MI for these Effective Meters, you have to set Inherited=Yes. You can enter reading only for Effective Meters/Physical Meters from parent MI. Readings for Effective Meters in child MI will be calculated and propagated across MI's hierarchy by the system (please see here).

## Definition of Inspection Points for MI

Let's assume you want to record pressure in bars in your car's right and left front tires, and if the pressure is too low, you want to generate Maintenance Order.

1. Define MI: My Car.
2. Define UoM *(Main Menu/Administration/Setup/Stock Management/Units of Measure*): Bar.
3. Define Point Type (check here): Tire.
4. Define Aspect Type (see here): Pressure with UoM=Bar.
5. For object My Car:
    - In the tab Inspection Points/Points (here), define Points with Point Type=Tire:

      - Front Right,
      - Front Left,
    - In tab Inspection Points/Aspects (here), define with Aspect Type=Pressure:

      - Pressure in Tire (UoM = Bar)
      - Nominal Value = 2,5
      - Min. Critical = 2,3
      - Min. Std. MO = Pump air (Maintenance Order Template).
    - In the tab Inspection Points/Aspect Points (here), define Aspect Point using Points and Aspect:

      - Pressure in Tire - Front Right
      - Pressure in Tire - Front Left
    - Save data.

## Findings Usage

Findings are used during MO recording in Task → Checkpoint. You can select the result from a list.

To share the finding in the list, you have to do as follows:

1. Define the finding (check here). You can define the finding as General or share it for MI Class/MI Category.

    ![Findings](./media/overview/finding-01.webp)
2. In the Checkpoint Template, select the Import Findings button to update the list in the Findings tab in the contexts of MI Class/MI Category from the checkpoint header.

    ![Mi Class](./media/overview/mi-class-category.webp)
3. Select checkboxes for findings that have to be available in the findings list in Checkpoint:

    ![Findings System Message](./media/overview/findings-system-message.webp)
4. Now, the selected findings are available during checkpoint recording.

    ![Inspection Readings](./media/overview/inspection-reading.webp)

## Maintenance Order Template definition schema

Check <!-- TODO: Add Link --> here.

## Maintenance Order creation schema

Check <!-- TODO: Add Link --> here.

## MO recording

Recording of MO is possible in MO with the Status set to Started.

The first user has to record checkpoints (check <!-- TODO: Add Link --> here and for definition here). If all checkpoints with Required Entry=Yes have Done=Yes (automatically checked when reading the document is closed), then Task is checked as done. If the Task does not have checkpoints in the checklist, then you report the task in its line by selecting the g Done. If the task has a checkpoint in the list, you are obligated to report each checkpoint. When all the jobs are done, you can change to Finished.

Select checkpoint in Checklist and select RMBM option Inspection Reading for checkpoint related to inspections, Type: Inspection, Checklist Item, Quantitative, Qualitative, Question.

![Inspection Reading](./media/overview/inspection-reading-2.webp)

Or RMBM option Meter Reading for checkpoint with Type=Meter Reading:

![Type=Meter Reading](./media/overview/image2020-1-30-13-14-50.png)

You can create many Inspection Reading/Meter Reading Documents for each checkpoint line. The last document is visible in the checkpoint line (column: Meter Reading or Inspection Reading). You can create the following document if the previous one is closed. You can review documents – Records History (RMBM option).
