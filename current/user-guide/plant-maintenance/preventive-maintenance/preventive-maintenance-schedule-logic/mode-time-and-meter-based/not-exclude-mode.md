# Not Exclude Mode

Meeting the conditions of one mode generates a MO and calculates the value only for that mode while leaving the value of the condition for the second mode unchanged. The conditions of the second mode are not recalculated. This means that there is a lack of synchronization of modes. That is, for an event that meets the conditions of one of the modes, the values are converted only for that mode.
