Meeting Time Based conditions generate MO, skipping conditions Meter Based on this iteration, and calculating values for both modes. Conversely, meeting Meter Based conditions generates MO and skipping conditions for Time Based and calculating values for both modes. This means the synchronicity of both modes. That is, for an event that meets the conditions of one of the mode, the values for both modes are recalculated.
