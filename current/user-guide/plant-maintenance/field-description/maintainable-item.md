# Maintainable Item

## Maintainable Item (MI)

:::info
    Main Menu → Plant Maintenance → Maintainable Item
:::

![Maintainable Item](./media/maintainable-item/image2020-3-11-12-31-54.png)
*Fig. Maintainable Item – definition schema*

You can define MI as a stand-alone or associated object. In the second case, you have to link existing object in the system.

![Maintainable Item](./media/maintainable-item/mi-01.png)

### Header

**MI Code** – a code of the object that will be serviced

**MI Name** – a maintainable Item name

**MI Type** – a hierarchical type of object

- **Location** – locations are physical locations of systems, positions, and assets. A location is a place. Hierarchy rules:

  - An asset CAN NOT be a parent for a location
  - A position CAN NOT be a parent for a location
  - A system CAN NOT be a parent for a location
  - A location can only have one location as a parent

- **System** – a collection of positions and/or assets that work together so that all parts are affected when one part goes down. Hierarchy rules:

  - An asset CAN NOT be a parent for a system
  - A position CAN NOT be a parent for a system
  - A system can have only one system as a parent
  - A system can have only one location as a parent

- **Position** – functional positions for assets. Used for tracking maintenance to specific positions within a structure. Hierarchy rules:

  - A position can have only one parent that is an asset
  - A position can have only one parent that is a position
  - A position can have only one parent that is a system
  - A position can have only one location as a parent

- **Asset** – equipment is entities where you store data and create work orders. An asset is a base unit of equipment. They are the smallest tracking unit. Hierarchy rules:

  - An asset can have only one parent that is an asset
  - An asset can have only one parent that is in a position
  - An asset can have only one parent that is a system
  - An asset can have only one location as a parent

**MI Class** – the system allows you to separate entities into groups. For example, you can assign classes to Maintainable Items and then give all air conditioning units a class of "HVAC." Please see here

**MI Category** – you can use categories to provide a way to organize pieces of equipment further. For example, if a class is defined for motors, create a category for motor types and sizes. Since an Object Class is a large group of similar things, think of Object Categories as sub-sets of Object Classes. Please see here

**Status** – select a code for the MI status: Awaiting purchase, Purchased/in-store, In-store, In repair, To be repaired, Withdrawn, Installed, In transit

**Commission Date** – date of installation

**Withdrawal Date** – enter the date on which the equipment is withdrawn from service

**Parent MI Code** – parent MI in hierarchy accordingly to rules. You can check the hierarchy of MIs by RMBM option - MIs Structure Report. Please see here

**Parent MI Name** – a name of parent MI

**Parent MI Type** – a hierarchical type of parent MI

**Dependent** – if select, the resource is dependent on the parent asset. If in the MO checkbox, MI Excluded is selected, MO's header MI is not available for production. MO's time is excluded from the scheduling, visible as a grey bar on Gantt Chart - resource view. The MO in status: scheduled, started, released. If the MI is a parent for another MI, and in the child MI definition Dependent = Yes, then excluded time is visible on Gantt for the child MI (Resource). It works this way down the MIs structure.

**Assigned Object** – if the checkbox is checked, then an object from the system can be 1 to 1 linked with MI

- **Resource link**

    ![Resource Link](./media/maintainable-item/resource-link.webp)

    **Resource Code** – a resource code and Type (Machine, Tool)

    **Resource Name** – description form the resource record

    ![MI PM](./media/maintainable-item/mi-pm.webp)

    **Item Code/Revision** – when you select Item Code from the list system automatically populates Revision and Item Name.

    **Item Name** – Item name

    **Apparatus Type** – you can select one of the three types: Meter, Tool, Part

    **Equipment Card** – equipment card associated with a serial number (Main Menu/Service/Equipment Card)

## TAB Effective Meters

Effective Meter is a relationship between a Meter Unit and an Object and is described by Effective Meter Type. This relationship is defined to record the cumulative usage of an object throughout its operational life, regardless of how many times a corresponding physical meter resets or is replaced. This cumulative usage or effective meter reading, updated from readings taken from a physical meter, always increases over time – it never resets (e.g., in physical physical meter, always increases over time – it never resets (e.g., like in a meter that counts up to 999 that resets to 000 after reaching one unit more than 999)). A physical meter can only be linked to one effective meter at a time.

![Diagram](./media/maintainable-item/mi-diagram-2.webp)

**EM Type** – a type of effective meter here

**Type Name** – the name of EM Type

**Meter Unit** – the unit of measure for the Effective Meter

**Inherited** – if the checked readings are calculated and propagated based on readings from the parent Effective Meter with the same EM Type, it is impossible to enter direct meter readings. Linking of Physical Meter is not possible

**Physical Meter MI Code** – select the code of the physical meter, if any. MIs with Apparatus Type= Meter, Meter Unit (Physical Meter) = Meter Unit (EM Type) are available. Physical Meter can be linked to one of the MI's Effective Meter just by right-clicking on the Effective Meter a choose "Physical Meter Connection."

**Entry Type** – reading input mode:

**Reading** – user enters the current meter reading
Difference – user enters the difference between the last reading and the current reading

:::note
    After the first reading, it is impossible to change this type. If a physical meter is linked, only Reading mode is available.
:::

**Last Reading** – previous reading value

**Reading** – current reading value from the newest Meter Reading document

**Derived Reading** – calculated reading according to Entry Type

:::

You can define the Effective Meter Type (EM Type), then assign this EM Type to the MI. The same EM Type you can use many times for different MIs.

**EM Type** – a type of Effective Meter

### Meter Reading

You can enter Meter Reading directly for MI’s EM Type, or you can do this via Physical Meter. To do this, you must first define the Physical Meter as an MI with Apparatus Type = Meter. Please see here

You can open the Meter Reading document from MI Master Data (RMBM Option Meter Reading on the line with EM Type) or Maintenance Order (RMBM Option Meter Reading on the line with Checkpoint in Checklist)
