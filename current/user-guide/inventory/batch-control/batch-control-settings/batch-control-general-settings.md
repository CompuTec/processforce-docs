# Batch Control General Settings

Batch settings cover different batch-related functions, e.g., default batch status for different kinds of documents or Batch Templates. The settings can be set for three different levels, depending on the range of influence that a user wants to cover:

- General Settings
- Item Group
- Item Details

Click [here](/docs/processforce/user-guide/system-initialzation/general-settings/inventory-tab/) to check detailed information about Batch configuration (based on the example of General Settings).
