## Operations

:::info Path
Production → Routings → Operations
:::

This form allows the user to define operations, which will be a part of the routing for making the product.

### Header

#### QC Active

This checkbox determines whether a specific Operation is affected by the Create QC Document for Operation on MOR status change option **ADD LINK**.

The checkbox is also available from the Manufacturing Order, Production Process, Routing form level.

#### Force Order

Checking this checkbox blocks starting this Operation on any Manufacturing Order (booking time in either ProcessForce or CompuTec PDC) before the previous Operation is not finished.

The checkbox is also available from the Manufacturing Order, Production Process, Routing form level.

#### Rounding

When this checkbox is checked, the system rounds a number of Item pieces to an integer.

**Example**

There is a Manufacturing Order with 5 pieces (pcs) in Planned Quantity. There are 4 Resources in an Operation. Without the checkbox checked, each Resource has 1,25 pcs assign (5 pcs by 4 Resources). Run Time is 8 h/pc.

If the Rounding checkbox is checked, the system will act the following way: 5 pcs : 4 Resources = round down to 1 and assign the remaining amount to the last Resource:

- 1st Resource: 1 pc x 8 h,

- 2nd Resource: 1 pc x 8 h,

- 3rd Resource: 1 pc x 8 h,

- 4th Resource: 2 pcs x 8 h.

Other examples:

- 3 pcs : 4 Resources = 3 Resources, 1 pc each, the last Resource 0 pcs,

- 11 pcs : 4 Resources = 3 Resources, 3 pcs each, the last Resource 2 pcs.

The checkbox is also available from the Manufacturing Order, Production Process, Routing form level.
