# Routing

Routing consists of Operations and Resources. You can set the required values for both of them.

You can define Multiple Routings for a product, but you have to set one of them as a default in the related Bill of Material.

Routes may be active or non-active by checking the active checkbox within the form header.

Routings are an optional function to be used in conjunction with Bills of Materials and Manufacturing Orders.
