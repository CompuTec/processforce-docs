When you have doubts that the scenario results are correct, please report the problem in a ticket on Computer Support. To document tickets, please use debug mode.

To turn on debug mode, please add the address line:
`http://localhost:54000/webcontent/launchpad/webapp/Index.html?aedebug=true` and Enter.

You can recognize that you are in debug mode by:

5. Attach the file to a ticket on the Computec support website. Add necessary information and optionally, screenshots.
6. When you finish, exit from debug mode.

To turn off debug mode, replace "true" with "false" in the address line:

- Before: `http://localhost:54000/webcontent/launchpad/webapp/Index.html?aedebug=true#/plugin/computec.appengine.MRP&home`
- After: `http://localhost:54000/webcontent/launchpad/webapp/Index.html?aedebug=false#/plugin/computec.appengine.MRP&home`
