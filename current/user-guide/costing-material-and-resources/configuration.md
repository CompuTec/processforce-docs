Within a Standard Costing environment, WIP variances will occur when there are differences between planned vs. actual quantities and cost and the cost of the finished product.

The standard production configuration is to check Parent Item WIP Accounts.

### Warehouses

- When a new warehouse is added, depending on the SAP Business One configuration, new warehouses are automatically added to the Item Master record.
- In turn, each warehouse is added to each Item Costing record.
- If a warehouse is deleted, this warehouse is deleted from each Item Costing record.
- For Drop Ship warehouses, these are not added to the Item Costing record.

## ProcessForce Settings
