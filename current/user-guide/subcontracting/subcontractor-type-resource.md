## Overview

Subcontracting can be taken into the production process by creating subcontractor-type Resources, adding to Operation, and adding Operation to Routing.

## Resources

A resource type may be set as a Subcontractor for a service performed by an external organization.

- Select the resource type Subcontractor. After a selection, several additional fields are displayed.
