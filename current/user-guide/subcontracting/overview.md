# Overview

Subcontracting is a method of managing a “purchase of a service.” For example, items are sent to the subcontractor for service, e.g., painting, heat treatment, or annealing.

The service is a part of the production process, and there is no change in the Item Code for the parent.

Subcontracting in ProcessForce can be performed using one of the following procedures:

- using Subcontractor type Resource,
- creating External type Manufacturing Order.
