- When inventory is issued and received, financial postings occur within an External WIP account, thus providing visibility of the production value at the subcontractor.

- At the appropriate level (implementation decision) for the WIP Inventory and Inventory Variance Account, set the account codes for External WIP and WIP Variance.
