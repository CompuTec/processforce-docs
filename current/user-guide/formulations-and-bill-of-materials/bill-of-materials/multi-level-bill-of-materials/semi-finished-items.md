# Semi-finished Items

A semi-finished item has its own Bill of Materials but is also a part of a finished product Bill of Materials. In the example below, Product 1.2 is semi-finished: it has its structure (Product 1.2.1 and 1.2.2). For this kind of Item, another Manufacturing Order has to be created (apart from the finished product) when the final product is produced. Items like this can also be produced separately (as their final product) and stored.

Semi-finished Items Manufacturing Orders (linked to final product Manufacturing Orders) can be managed from Semi-finished Product Scheduling Board.
