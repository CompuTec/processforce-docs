# Properties

This form allows the user to define a specific property – physical and chemical characteristics, e.g., color.

The corresponding groups and subgroups can also be defined, for example, physical and color.

A list of valid values may also be defined from the reference library. For example, color has valid values of yellow, blue, red, and green.

Checking the Quality Control Testing box implies that the Item Property will be used during the QC testing process.
