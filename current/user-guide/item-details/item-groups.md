The Item Group Group function allows the user to define a grouping of a grouping, which is used to group similar sub-sets of items to aid in reporting and analysis.

For example, an item can belong to the group boxes and another grouping packaging.

## Item Group assigning

A once-created item group can be assigned to an item in the Item Details form, Groups tab. By clicking a second column and then a circle displayed within a field, a proper Item Group can be chosen:
