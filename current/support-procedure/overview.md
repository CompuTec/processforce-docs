    **Note 2** If you take our scripts and modify them, which then causes an issue of any sort which requires our team to spend time reviewing your scripts etc., we will charge you for the time spent in fixing these issues on a time and material basis at an hourly rate of 150 EUR/USD, plus expenses if applicable. Before any work is started, an e-mail confirmation is required between both parties that these charges will be applied for and accepted.
