## CompuTec ProcessForce Extension

Here you can download all CompuTec ProcessForce versions for SAP Business One 10.0.

:::note
    Read more about the system requirements, first installation, and the upgrade of CompuTec ProcessForce extension.
:::

:::note ProcessForce and SAP Business One compatibility
    It is possible to use any SAP Business One 10.0 version with any ProcessForce 10.0 version.

    We always recommend using the latest available version.

    If you decide to use any previous versions of SAP Business One, please avoid FP2105 HF1 and FP2108, as there is a DI API bug that does not allow synchronization of ProcessForce Manufacturing Orders to SAP Business One Production Orders: [3098465 - Error While Updating Production Orders Using the Data Interface (DI API)](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/3098465)

    It was fixed by SAP in FP2108 HF1.

## CompuTec ProcessForce API

Here you can download CompuTec ProcessForce API installers.

:::note
    CompuTec ProcessForce API is not installed automatically with CompuTec ProcessForce 10.0. CompuTec ProcessForce extension doesn't need it installed as it uses the API .dll directly from its folder.

    If you use CompuTec PDC 2.x or lower, CompuTec WMS Server, CompuTec AppEngine or you wrote an external application which consumes it – you have to install it manually in these cases.

    CompuTec PDC 3.x and higher is based on CompuTec AppEngine and doesn't require local CompuTec ProcessForce API installation any more.

    Please also note that if you use ProcessForce API on the same machine where ProcessForce extension is used, you need to first upgrade ProcessForce API to the same version as the new ProcessForce extension before you start its upgrade. Otherwise, the upgrade will fail.
