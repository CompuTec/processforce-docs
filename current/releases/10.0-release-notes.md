        - A system message displayed upon attempts to create a Pick Order without available Numbering Series improved (the previous one was not clear in communicating what the problem is)
    
    **Minor changes and improvements**

### Fixes (R2)

    **Installer, SAP Business One Cloud**

        - The synchronization of ProcessForce extension for Lightweight Deployment fails in SAP Business One Cloud Control Center when Enable Extension Compatibility Check option is checked (affected builds: 10.0.1.16 – 10.0 R1 version and 10.0.2.88 – 10.0 R2)
    
    **Pick and Pack**

    **Pick Order**

    -    Manufacturing Order, Pick Order: the system ignores Branch of a Numbering Series upon creation of Pick Order when two or more Series for Pick Order are set for different Branches. As a result, the first Numbering Series is always assigned

    - Pick Order, Batch Selector: an error occurs upon attempts to auto-select Batches (for an Item not primarily issued by Bin Locations)

    **Resources**
