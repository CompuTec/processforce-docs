# Overview

Here, you can find information on the data model.

The model contains 40 calculation views, 10 of which are views that can be a direct source for analytics tools (like Dashboards, KPIs, SAP Cloud Analytics, or Microsoft Excel). The rest of the views are of the indirect type.

A specific view can also be used in a standard SQL query.
