ProcessForce is an SAP Business One lightweight extension (add-on).
Each version of ProcessForce has the same system requirements as **the SAP Business One version that it is installed with**.

Additional memory is only required on the Personal Computer (PC) or server where the Gantt chart is used and Cost Roll-Up is run. This depends on the amount of data and might vary from 1-2 GB to 16 GB.

ProcessForce has a minimal disk consumption of 130 MB.

In addition, ProcessForce requires:

- **Microsoft .NET Framework** – .NET Framework 4.7 is the minimum version supported by ProcessForce 10.0.
- We recommend installing the latest version of .NET Framework – you can use the Windows Update tool or download the required installer file manually using this [Microsoft site](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/dotnet-framework-runtime).
- To determine which .NET Framework version is installed in a system, please visit this [Microsoft Docs site](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/migration-guide/how-to-determine-which-versions-are-installed).
