After clicking it, the CT icon appears in the Windows notification area:

![CT shortcut](./media/direct-access/CT-shortcut.webp)

After opening the Manager, the COMPUTEC SERVICE MANAGER window appears. Here you can start/stop/restart a chosen CompuTec service:

![CT Service Manager](./media/direct-access/CT-Service-Manager_1.webp)

Configuring the settings of a selected service is possible after clicking the Settings button.

Terminal Licensing is a section for managing the license of CompuTec PDC / CompuTec WMS products.

## CompuTec License Server settings

You can change Server Name and Port Number in the Server Settings tab. You do not have to change the default values:

![CT Server Settings](./media/direct-access/CT-License-Server-Settings_1_Server-Settings1.webp)

You can also specify a logging level and see a disk location where logs are kept.

## Configuring CompuTec License Server database connection – enabling Direct Data Access mode

1. In the COMPUTEC LICENSE SERVER SETTINGS window, switch to the Database Connection tab:

    ![Database settings](./media/direct-access/CT-License-Server-Settings_2_Db-Connection_1.webp)

2. Specify the SAP Business One database server name/address. You can take it from here:

    :::info Path
        SAP Business One → Administration → Choose Company
    :::

    ![Choose company server](./media/direct-access/choose-company-server2.webp)

    Click the Add button after setting the server name:

    ![Connection](./media/direct-access/CT-License-Server-Settings_2_Db-Connection_2.webp)

    :::info
        Depending on a database server type, specify the server name in the below format:

        | Database Server Type                   | Server Name Format      | Example                |
        | -------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------- |
        | Microsoft SQL Server, default Instance | ServerName              | Test-System            |
        | Microsoft SQL, Named Instance          | ServerName\InstanceName | Test System\Production |
        | SAP HANA                               | ServerName:Port         | 10.0.0.199:30015       |
    :::

    You can check the Microsoft SQL Server server/instance name using the Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio tool:

    <details>
        <summary>Click here to find out more</summary>
        <div>![SQL Server](./media/direct-access/sql-server-management-studio.webp)</div>
    </details>

    You can read the SAP Business One HANA server and port in the SAP Business One installation:

    <details>
        <summary>Click here to find out more</summary>
        <div>![HANA](./media/direct-access/hana-address.webp)</div>
    </details>

3. Set a database server type of added server:
  
    ![License Server](./media/direct-access/license-server-settings_2_db-connection_3.webp)

4. Specify a database user name the password, and click Save:

    ![License Server](./media/direct-access/license-server-settings_2_db-connection_4.webp)

5. If inserted data are correct, then the 'Data has been saved' message appears, and the company database number is displayed next to the server position:

    :::caution
        Please note that the application does not show a newly restored/imported company database until Choose Company list in the SAP Business One client is refreshed.
    :::

    ![Caution](./media/direct-access/license-server-settings_2_db-connection_5.webp)

    :::info
        After this step, the message: `Direct Data Access mode is disabled.` will not appear anymore while starting ProcessForce provided that the connection to CompuTec License Server is configured correctly in ProcessForce License Administration (see [Extension → License assignment section](../../installation/first-installation/extension)).
    :::

6. You can also expand the list of existing company databases to make sure that a particular SAP Business One company uses Direct Data Access:

    ![Expand List](./media/direct-access/license-server-settings_2_db-connection_6.webp)

    :::caution
        Please note that there is a need to refresh the list each time you add/import a new company database:

        ![Refresh](./media/direct-access/license-server-settings_2_db-connection_7.webp)
    :::

7. On a highlight of the added database server position, you will not see inserted database user name and actual password length anymore due to a created mask:

    ![Mask](./media/direct-access/license-server-settings_2_db-connection_8.webp)

    :::info
        It is possible to set up more than one database server:

        ![Multiple databases](./media/direct-access/license-server-settings_2_db-connection_9.webp)
