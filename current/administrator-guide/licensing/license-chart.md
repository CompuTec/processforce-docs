# License Comparition Chart

## SAP Business One functionality and ProcessForce license comparison chart

Here you can check which functionalities are assigned to a specific ProcessForce user license type.

However, all CompuTec ProcessForce users must have the same or higher ProcessForce license type as their SAP Business One license, e.g., SAP Business One limited logistics licensed users can use a ProcessForce little logistics license or a ProcessForce professional license.
